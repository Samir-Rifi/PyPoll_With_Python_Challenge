## Election-Audit Summary: 

Business proposal to the election commission:

The script used to audit this election results can be used for any other election and would help the commission have insightful details about how the election was and how the votes were distributed.

For example:

- We can change the wording “county” in the script by “province” to analyse how federal election performed by province and see what province had the highest participation rate and which one influenced the final election result.

- We can change the wording “county” by “city” to know how provincial elections performed by city and what cities had the higher participation rate and which ones drove the final result.
